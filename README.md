## About

This repository is intended as my future starting point for various projects. While using the Astro meta-framework as the starting point I have eliminated all use of `.astro` files in favour of Markdown's `.mdx` file syntax. For my components the Javascript framework I've chosen is SolidJS so that I can use the `.jsx` file extension; it's just a nice bonus that Solid seems even more performant than Svelte.

For the vast majority of the projects I have in mind I'll be building them out as single page applications and so make use of Astro's `ViewTransitions` to achieve this.

I also will be using Tailwind CSS and have pre-integrated it.
